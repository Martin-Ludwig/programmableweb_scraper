## About

Programmable web has not the option to filter by year. So this program gathers information about Name, Category and Submitted date from all entries at https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/mashups and saves that data as a json format. Then the json data can be processed to show in a plot how many mashups per year are published to the programmable web.

* plot: to create a plot diagramm from json
